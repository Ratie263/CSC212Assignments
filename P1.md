# Assignment P1: Aquarium Grading Rubric

***Due Date***: September 20, 2018.

Remember that we will have P2 opening on that day, so don't save it until the last minute!

- This assignment is composed of a total of ***64 mandatory points*** and ***79 optional points***. That's too many points in total.
- The assignment ***will be graded out of 100***. 
- This means that the best you can acquire is a much higher than 100, but it will ***not be used***. Someone who submits only 100 points and completes their functionality perfectly will have an equivalent grade to someone who does everything, so use your time wisely.
- Therefore, it probably makes sense to do a little extra, but not every single task.

## Mandatory Goals (sums to 64):

### Program Compiles (=30)

This includes that your code should be professional. 
- Try to proofread your work like an essay! 
- Find all your ``println("stuff")`` statements and remove them, etc.
- Your code looks intentional: don't just fiddle with it until it works. Reason about it! Sketch out the python by hand and then try translating to Java.
- Delete commented out code or experiments that don't work out. Make your submission as small as it needs to be.
- Your code is your own. Respect the honor code.
- You will have a Buddy in Lab to work with through the first two tasks; the code that solves them is sufficiently simple that you do not need to cite, but put a comment in your ``Fish`` class indicating who your buddy was.
- Have comments explaining tricky code!

This section will expand in detail, importance and value as the semester goes on.

### Little Fish Moves (=5)
There's a little red fish in the starter code. Let's help that little fish out! They want to move.

### Fish Class (=15)
I expect you to develop and improve on a Fish class. I don't expect you to be able to do it without the following variables:

- boolean isLittle
- int x, int y
- boolean facingLeft

### Fish destination system (=14)
- (2) A fish has a destination (chosen at random). 
- (4) It moves at a fixed speed toward that destination. Algebra! Distance Formula!
- (4) Your fish should face its destination.
- (4) When it is close enough to the destination, it chooses another.

## Optional Goals (Do at least 1 fully):

You may complete any subset of tasks for these options, so long as you fully complete at least one Option.
***I strongly suggest you start by doing Option 1, the easiest, and move into the harder one of your choice.***

### Option 1: Bubble Class and Bubble Array (=15)

This is one of the easier tasks, so it's worth slightly less.

- (3) You have a functioning Bubble object that drifts upward.
- (3) Your bubble reappears at the bottom of the tank after a delay.
- (3) You create a fixed bubble array of 10 bubbles. You may want a class ``BubbleSystem`` if you feel that your ``Aquarium`` class is getting too busy.
- (3) Bubbles are randomly sized, wiggle a little, etc.
- (3) Build a treasure-chest (or some other source of the bubbles).

### Option 2: HungryFish extends Fish (=20)

You can leave your fish from lab alone for now, and either create a subclass of it, or a whole new fish class, called HungryFish.

- (4) Food is visible in some part of the aquarium (it may be an area with kelp, seaweed, etc.)
- (4) When your fish is not in this area, it grows hungry.
- (4) Your fish picks destinations in the food zone when very hungry, and outside the zone when normal.
- (4) Display a hunger meter. When a fish is hungry, color it different, display a progress bar (6 points, not 4), or some other indicator to deal with it.
- (4) DIFFICULT! Fish food falls from above in the food zone, and a fish must stay there until food becomes visible (at which point their hunger goes to zero).

### Option 3: Algorithm, the Snail who loves Algae. (=20)

Algorithm is a snail that loves to eat algae. 

- (4) They sleep most of the time, and over time the tank gets greener. Hint: Just "animate" the green component of the ocean color.
- (4) They walk around the outside of the tank, upside-down if need be, since they stick to anything.
- (4) When it reaches a certain level, Algorithm wakes up, and starts eating the algae. Make their eyes open?
- (4) The water in the tank becomes more blue again.
- (4) When they get full, they fall back to sleep, wherever they are. So they must be moving!

### Option 4: Predator/Prey (=24)
 - (4) And lo, there was a Shark named Jaws. Or a Diver, named Frieda. Or some kind of predator.
 - (4) Your fish must be in an Array or List, for your predator hunts in a for loop.
 - (4) Your predator must have a similar destination system, except their destination is a particular Fish!
 - (4) When your predator reaches your fish (or close enough), the fish becomes eaten. This is sad, but life? :/
     - Your fish disappears?
     - Make sure your predator doesn't hunt a missing fish!
     - Your fish flips upside down and floats to the top?
 - (4) DIFFICULT! When your predator eats any fish, it scares the other fish. They should pick points far away. (Try corners that don't contain the predator?)
 - (4) DIFFICULT! When your predator eats all of the fish, it needs to have a dramatic exit, e.g.: to swim sadly off-screen. Then you can print "THE END."
